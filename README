Things you should know.

  `.chirprc`, and should have the same format as the sample file given.

* On typing your posts on the command line :

  * Right now, no extra processing is done on the message typed after the --.
  * In fact, this has less to do with the program and more to do with the shell
    you use, since it hasn't been passed to the program yet.
  * One way to make sure everything goes alright is to quote your message with
    single quotes ('), and escape any of those inside.
  * A sample widget for the zle (zsh) has been included, since that's the shell
    it was tested on.
  * For now, the only other option is to leave the message empty, and type it in
    inside chirp's input loop.
